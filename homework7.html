<h1>Homework 7: Illustrated Environment </h1>

<p>
The photo I used for this project was taken about two years ago when I went hiking.
I chose this image because I remember the scene clearly and I wanted to try turning 
  a real memory into a simple illustration. I imported the photo into Adobe Illustrator 
  on my iPad and I tried to simplify the shapes and colors while still keeping the
  feeling of the original place. I know my final illustration is not perfect. 
  Controlling the tools on the iPad was a bit difficult, especially with the lines 
  and color blending, but I did my best to adjust and fix the colors.
