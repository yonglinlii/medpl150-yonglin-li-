<p><em>This photo is special to me because it was my first time 
  walking in this area. In front of their store I saw a really

<p><em>This photo was taken in front of an ice cream 
  shop near my school. I’ve always wanted to try it but

  used it to practice Photoshop for this assignment.</em></p>
