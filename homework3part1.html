  <p>This photo is special to me because it was my first time 
  walking in this area. In front of their store I saw a really 
  cool bicycle. I didn’t know what it was made of, but at that
  moment I wanted to take a picture because it looked unique and expensive.</p>

  <img src="deep.jpg" width="600">
  <p>I’m very sorry, Professor. At that time I really don't know how to take deep depth photo, 
    so I used an existing photo and edited it myself to practic.</p>

  <p><em>This photo was taken in front of an ice cream shop near my school. 
    I’ve always wanted to try it but never have. That day I passed by, took a quick photo
    and used it to practice Photoshop for this assignment.</em></p>
