  <h2>Motherhood in Crisis Reflection</h2>

    <p>

      When I read Motherhood in Crisis, what struck me most was the power of illustration.
      It tells the story of mothers from all over the world, from different countries, but 
      facing similar pressures, some struggling to care for their children during war, 
      others struggling with anxiety due to societal pressures. Although these stories 
      also include photos and videos, I think the illustrations are the part that moved
      me the most. Because illustrations not only depict scenes, but also express a kind 
      of ”emotion“, allowing me to truly feel the difficulties faced by different mothers. 
      I love illustration because it allows us to control what the viewer sees and how we 
      feel about it. Photos sometimes have too many cluttered things, but illustrations 
      can use simple lines and colors to focus our attention on the emotions we want to 
      express most. For example, illustrations convey the strength and tenderness of mothers. 
      Despite the hardships of wartime, they strive to protect their children. For example, 
      a mother hugging her child, and the sunlight in the background convey hope and love. 
      Compared to pure text, illustrations are more human. Text tells you the facts, while 
      illustrations allow you to feel and infer the emotions behind them. I think the 
      combination of these two approaches is particularly effective, as it creates both 
      substance and warmth. After reading this, I’m more inclined to think about these 
      mothers‘ stories. It’s about feeling their stories with all our hearts, rather 
      than quickly forgetting them like we do with regular news stories. These stories 
      remind me of my own mother. Although they come from different countries and have 
      different lives, they share the same passion for persevering for their families. 
      Each of the illustrations makes me feel their love and strength. I think this is 
      what‘s most touching about the illustrations.
