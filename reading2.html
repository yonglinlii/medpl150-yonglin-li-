  <title>Reading Reflection 2 - Nesrine Malik “AI Slop”</title>
</head>
<body>
  We’re living in a time where everything feels mixed up, real and fake. Sometimes I scroll on social 
  media and realize I can’t even tell what’s real anymore. Even the pictures and captions I post on my 
  social media can be fake sometimes. Now AI is getting so powerful that the things it makes look almost 
  perfect, and it’s really hard to see what’s true or not.

  After reading Nesrine Malik’s “With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster,”
  I totally felt what she was saying. There are AI-generated pictures, faces, and even videos everywhere now. 
  Malik calls this “AI slop,” and she says it’s quietly changing the way we see the world. These AI pictures 
  look so real, but they don’t have a soul. After a while, people might lose the ability to tell what’s real 
  and what’s fake.

  She says, “Who controls the image controls the narrative.” That line really stuck with me, because in my 
  anthropology class I just read an article about something similar. It talked about how, in the late 1800s,
  many white photographers took pictures of Indigenous people. Those photos were supposed to “show different 
  cultures,” but everything, like the clothes and the poses was arranged by the photographers. However, the 
  picture they published shows the people look poor, dirty, and uncivilized. When these photos spread, they 
  made people think those groups were backward. So images became a kind of power tool for white people to 
  decide who others were. Later Wendy Red Star’s project “Apsáalooke Bacheeitüuk in Washington, D.C.” She 
  takes those old photos and tells the story again in her own way. She adds colors, notes, and real names 
  to the pictures , things that were missing before.

  Both Malik and Red Star show that every image is a kind of control. It decides whose story we see and 
  whose story we ignore. When fake AI pictures fill the internet, it’s like the same power structure 
  happening again, just with new technology. That’s why we shouldn’t just scroll and believe everything 
  we see. If we don’t think about who made the picture and why they want us to see it, we’re just walking 
  into someone else’s fake story.
