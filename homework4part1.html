  <h2>Why this picture?? </h2>
  <p>This photomontage combines three different moments and places. The background photo 
    of me in the blue dress was taken in Cape May, New Jersey, on a very sunny and hot day.
    The photo of my hand holding the camera was shot in my classroom. The image displayed 
    inside the camera was taken a few days earlier by Angelene in the school auditorium. By 
    merging these three photos, I created a single image that brings together very different settings.

    My goal with this photomontage is to show how the images we see through a camera are not always 
    real. In todayâ€™s digital world, many things we see in photos can be edited or staged. By combining
    and manipulating these pictures, I wanted to remind viewers not to fully believe everything 
    in a photograph, what appears on the screen may not be the full truth!!!
